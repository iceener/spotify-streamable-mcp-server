  instructions: `Use these tools to find music, get the current player status, control and transfer playback, and manage playlists and saved songs.

Tools
- search_catalog: Find songs, artists, albums, or playlists. Inputs: queries[], types[album|artist|playlist|track], optional market (2-letter), limit (1-50), offset (0-1000), include_external['audio']. Returns per-query ordered items (slim fields like id, name, uri; tracks include artists).
- player_status: Read current player, available devices, queue, and current track. Use this first to discover device_id before control.
- spotify_control: Batch control with operations[]. action ∈ {play,pause,next,previous,seek,volume,shuffle,repeat,transfer,queue}. Provide matching params (position_ms, volume_percent, repeat, device_id, context_uri/uris, offset, queue_uri, transfer_play). Optional parallel=true runs operations concurrently. The tool automatically fetches player status after actions and reports whether playback is active, the target device, and current volume. Before transfer, call player_status to pick a device; if no active device exists, ask the user to open Spotify.
- spotify_playlist: Manage playlists. action ∈ {list_user,get,items,create,update_details,add_items,remove_items,reorder_items}.
- spotify_library: Manage saved songs. action ∈ {tracks_get,tracks_add,tracks_remove,tracks_contains}.

 Notes
 - If a call returns Unauthorized, ask the user to authenticate and retry.
 - Prefer small limits and minimal polling unless asked to do otherwise.
 - Use player_status to pick device_id before control. If no active device is found, prompt the user to open Spotify and/or transfer to a listed device.
 - After control actions, the tool includes a concise status. For full details, you can still call player_status. If not playing, ask the user to open Spotify or transfer to a listed device.`,
